## What Is Computer Vision And OpenCV
Computer vision is a field of computer science which focuses on how a computer can use digital images to gain a high-level understanding of a scene. Computer vision is often used to automate tasks, for example: object recognition, facial recognition, and motion tracking, just to name a few. Computer vision is used in self-driving cars, camera technology, security cameras, and assembly line automation.

## Reasons For Creating This Guide
I created this guide to introduce the reader to computer vision and the functionality of the OpenCV Library. This guide is intended to be more of a ‘how to’ guide focused on applicability and usability, as opposed to a deep dive into the theory and mathematics taking place behind the scenes. 
I created the guide in this way because as one is learning they don’t necessarily need to concern themselves with what is happening in the background. For example, when someone is first learning to drive a car, they learn how to move the steering wheel, press the pedals, and put the gear lever into forward or reverse. They are then able drive the car from one place to another. The person learning to drive the car does not need to know how a 4-stroke engine, automatic transmission, and differential work. Only once they can drive competently they should then learn about the inner workings of a vehicle. 
So too is my philosophy in learning the OpenCV library. You must learn to use the functions available before you need to learn how the matrices of data are mathematically computed. This guide will teach you how to drive the car and prepare you to look under the hood.
